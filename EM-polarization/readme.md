The purpose of this application is to simulate how an ideal metallic cylindrical shell would react to an external electric field by calculating the surface charge density and then its polarization. Since the metal is ideal, the voltage on its surface has to be constant, therefore the charge in the shell is polarized. The project involves modeling the shell as a matrix of elements which react to the external field by canceling it with their own electric field. By this model and constraints, we can calculate the charge density using linear algebra.
